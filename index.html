    The web is a bunch of computers that communicate with each other via the Internet. When a person goes to a web page their computer sends a HTTP Request to a server. The server finds the appropriate HTML document and sends it back to the user's computer where a web browser interprets the page and displays it on the user's screen.

       <p>HTML stands for <em><b>Hypertext Markup Language.</b></em> HTML documents form the majority of the content on the web. HTML documents contain text content which describes "what you see" and markup which describes "how it looks". This video gives a good overview.</p>

     <div class="notes"> <p> This refers to the idea that computers only do what they are "told." This means when coding explicit instructions need to be given for any scenario that may be encountered, luckily coding frameworks establish most of these "basic" instructions so they don't constantly need to be repeated.</p>
